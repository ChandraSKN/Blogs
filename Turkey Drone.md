# Asisguard Songar: Turkey’s Quadrotor Armed Drone System

## Overview  
Asisguard’s **Songar** is a low-altitude, quadrotor unmanned combat aerial vehicle developed to provide frontline forces with a rapidly deployable, precision-strike capability. The complete system includes the UAV itself, a backpack-portable ground control station (GCS), and all necessary support equipment.

## Design and Subsystems  
Every Songar airframe spans **1.4 m** rotor-to-rotor and divides functionally into these subsystems:
- **Propulsion & power**: High-efficiency electric motors driven by a compact battery pack  
- **Guidance & navigation**: GPS/GLONASS modules, inertial sensors, and autonomous flight software  
- **Payload**: Quick-swap weapon mounts or non-lethal canister modules  
- **Safety & control**: Multi-layered hardware/software interlocks that lock firing systems until explicit operator authorization  

## Key Specifications  
- **Maximum takeoff weight**: 44 kg  
- **Maximum payload**: 9 kg  
- **Size**: 140 cm rotor-to-rotor  
- **Speed**: 10 m/s standard; up to 15 m/s with optimized payload  
- **Service ceiling**: 3 000 m MSL; 300 m AGL  
- **Range**: 3 km standard; 5 km optional  
- **Endurance**: ~25–30 min (no payload)  
- **Environmental rating**: IP67 dust/water resistance; operates in 0 °C to 40 °C; withstands winds up to 10 m/s  

## Navigation & Control  
Songar can switch seamlessly between **manual** and **autonomous** flight modes. Operators use the GCS’s moving-map interface to plan waypoints; the drone will automatically follow the route and safely return home if it loses link or hits a low-battery threshold. Live telemetry and dual video feeds (daylight + infrared) stream back in real time.

## Payload Variants  
By swapping modular mounts, Songar adapts to diverse mission profiles:
- **5.56×45 mm automatic rifle**: Stabilized barrel, up to 200 rounds, quick-change magazine  
- **2×40 mm & 6×40 mm grenade launchers**: High-volume indirect fire for area suppression  
- **3×81 mm mortar gripper**: Precision mortar delivery for obstacle neutralization  
- **Non-lethal canister module**: Up to eight tear-gas or smoke canisters under multi-layer safety locks  

## Ground Control Station  
The ergonomic GCS fits into a single backpack and features:
- **Touchscreen moving-map** for mission planning  
- **Live video & telemetry** display with recording/playback controls  
- **Multi-drone management** for coordinated swarm operations  

## Deployment & Integration
