In October 2018, India and Russia signed a government-to-government agreement worth **$5.43 billion** for five S-400 Triumf regiments. The deal was finalized at the BRICS summit and cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Security later that year. By December 2021, the first battery was operational at Ambala, followed by additional deployments through early 2023—establishing a multi-layered defense umbrella along the western frontier [^1]

shortly after midnight on May 8,2025 when radar operator noticed dozens of faint blips streaking across the screen. Moments later, the ***S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra”*** battery sprang to life. As Pakistan-launched drones breached the western border, the S-400’s long-range 96L6 surveillance radar locked onto every target—tracking over 300 threats and guiding interceptor missiles to eliminate 36 of them before they could reach populated areas [^2]. In the calm that followed, operatoor watched relief convoys roll safely past the launch site, proof that the nation’s newest shield had held strong.

The S-400 system combines multiple radars, fire-control directors, and missile types into one cohesive networked defense umbrella. Key elements include:
- **96L6 “Cheese Board” 3D radar** for long-range detection  
- **91N6E “Big Bird” acquisition radar** to refine target tracks  
- **40N6 and 48N6E3 missiles**, capable of engaging targets up to **400 km** away  
- **Mobile transporter-erector-launchers (TELs)** that relocate swiftly after firing [^3] 

On the night of the incursion, Pakistani drones flew low to evade conventional air defenses. Yet the S-400’s layered coverage—tracking from near-ground level up to **30,000 m** altitude—meant there was no blind spot. As the first salvo of **48N6E3 interceptors** soared skyward, operators watched infrared footage confirm each successful hit. By dawn, local reports confirmed zero civilian casualties and only minor damage to border posts, thanks to the system’s unwavering precision [^4]

In his address the following morning, Prime Minister Modi praised India’s “strategic prowess,” noting how advanced air defenses had neutralized every incoming drone and missile, safeguarding schools, temples, and homes across targeted regions [^5]. The S-400’s debut performance underscored its role not just as a deterrent, but as a life-saving guardian—ensuring communities could sleep peacefully even as threats loomed overhead.

Today, as Sudarshan Chakra batteries stand poised along India’s western frontier, the nation knows it wields a tool that blends cutting-edge radar, agile launchers, and supersonic interceptors into a steadfast sentinel—ready to defend Indian skies at a moment’s notice.
